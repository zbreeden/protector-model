# üõ°Ô∏è The Protector ‚Äî Interview Q&A
**File:** `Q&A.md`  
**Use:** Practice likely questions for the Silco Fire & Security interview.  
**Role:** Business Data Analyst (Cincinnati, OH)

## 1. Tell us about yourself.
**A:**  
I‚Äôve spent over a decade working with data in operational contexts ‚Äî mostly ETL, data wrangling, and reporting. Recently I‚Äôve focused on shaping that experience into analytics roles, building demos like *The Protector*, which turns Fire & Safety data into integrity and readiness dashboards. I enjoy taking messy, diverse data sources, normalizing them, and making them actionable for decision-makers.

---

## 2. Why do you want to work at Silco Fire & Security?
**A:**  
Silco‚Äôs mission resonates with me: protecting lives and property. It‚Äôs not abstract ‚Äî it‚Äôs real impact across Ohio and surrounding states. I want to bring my skills in data cleansing and normalization into that mission, making sure the data behind fire and security operations is as trustworthy as the systems themselves. Silco‚Äôs growth and recognition as a Top Workplace also suggest a company culture where I can grow long-term.

---

## 3. What experience do you have with data migration or integration?
**A:**  
In my prior work, I led ETL processes in market research, normalizing survey and operational data across multiple systems. I‚Äôve worked with SQL, Excel, and scripting to migrate datasets, reconcile discrepancies, and ensure referential integrity. My Protector demo shows how I can integrate multiple CSV ‚Äúsystems‚Äù (incidents, drills, maintenance, site data) into one usable Fire & Safety view ‚Äî that same skill applies to Salesforce data, acquisitions, or cross-department projects at Silco.

---

## 4. How do you approach cleaning and normalizing data?
**A:**  
I start by profiling the dataset ‚Äî understanding column types, ranges, and outliers. Next, I define the ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù and normalize to a standard schema. Then I apply transformations: trimming, formatting, deduplication, anomaly detection. Finally, I validate against business rules and share metrics. In *The Protector*, for example, I normalize incidents into `site, type, severity, response_min` ‚Äî a consistent format that drives metrics reliably.

---

## 5. Can you give an example of identifying and resolving a data anomaly?
**A:**  
In market research, I often saw length-of-interview anomalies ‚Äî surveys completed impossibly fast. By flagging those as outliers and reconciling with response logs, I improved data integrity for clients. In *The Protector*, I simulate this by flagging false alarms or overdue maintenance. The principle is the same: detect anomalies, trace root causes, and apply corrective actions.

---

## 6. How do you communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders?
**A:**  
I translate data into visuals and narratives. Instead of ‚Äúaverage response = 6.4m,‚Äù I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre responding in under 10 minutes 90% of the time ‚Äî well above industry expectations.‚Äù I also use dashboards that show green/yellow/red indicators. For Silco, my Protector demo is exactly that ‚Äî data integrity and safety performance distilled into KPIs and simple cards.

---

## 7. What tools are you comfortable with?
**A:**  
- **SQL**: writing queries, joins, and cleaning pipelines.  
- **Excel**: advanced functions, pivot tables, reconciliations.  
- **Power BI / Tableau**: visualization and dashboards.  
- **Scripting** (Python/JS): light ETL, automation, seeding data.  
I‚Äôm also eager to dive deeper into Salesforce data structures since they are central to Silco‚Äôs environment.

---

## 8. How do you think about data governance?
**A:**  
Governance is about defining standards and enforcing them consistently: data types, naming, access rules, and lifecycle. My approach is collaborative ‚Äî involving IT, data owners, and business users. In *The Protector*, I demonstrate governance by using consistent seeds (`incidents.csv`, `drills.csv`, etc.), schema definitions, and dashboards that highlight where rules are being broken (e.g., overdue maintenance).

---

## 9. What excites you about this role specifically?
**A:**  
The chance to combine **business context** with **data structure knowledge**. I enjoy shadowing departments, learning processes, and then shaping that into normalized, usable data. Silco‚Äôs scope ‚Äî from alarm monitoring to compliance ‚Äî creates diverse data challenges. This role lets me build bridges across that ecosystem and directly improve safety outcomes.

---

## 10. How would you measure success in this role?
**A:**  
- Data accuracy and consistency improve (fewer reconciliation issues).  
- Stakeholders trust the reports/dashboards delivered.  
- Faster turnaround on data questions from leadership.  
- Documented processes that scale as Silco grows.  
Ultimately: data is no longer a bottleneck, but an enabler for compliance and growth.

---

## 11. Any questions for us?
- How does Silco currently track and report on response time, compliance, and incidents across sites?  
- Where does data currently live (Salesforce, CMMS, spreadsheets)?  
- What does success for this role look like in the first 6 months?  
- How do you envision this analyst role collaborating with the CIO and Data Architect?
