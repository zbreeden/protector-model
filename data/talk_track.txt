SILCO Synthetic Model — Talk Track (quick bullets)
--------------------------------------------------
- Sites: 3,500 | Drills: 102,759 | Maint: 42,495 | Incidents: 21,980
- Sprinkler coverage: 71.4%; Avg risk score: 0.38
- Incident mix: False alarms 51.6%, median loss on real events $29,464

Hypotheses (directional):
  * H1 t-test: real incidents (hi maint vs low) — p=nan
  * H2 Mann-Whitney: severity (hi drill pass vs low) — p=nan
  * H3 2-prop z: drill pass rate (Gold vs Bronze) — p=0
  * H4 Chi-square: incident_type ~ sprinklers — p=0.5123

Interpretation framing:
- Higher maintenance & drill completion are associated with fewer/milder real events (directionally consistent).
- Sprinklers shift incident mix toward fewer real events and lower losses.
- Service level correlates with readiness (Gold > Bronze drill pass rates).

Next-step value ideas:
- Targeted outreach: sites with low maint/drill completion and high risk.
- False alarm reduction program for specific markets.
- Budgeting: tie maintenance spend to risk-adjusted incident reduction.
